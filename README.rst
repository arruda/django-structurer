===================================
Django Arpon Struct
===================================

About:
-----------------------------------

The purpose of this app is to enable some custom script for manage.py and for django-admin.py(maybe?) that creates a different folder structure for Django.
This structure what I thought of a good one for projects that I'm working, and that possibly you are working too.



Usage:
-----------------------------------
You can run the command::
    django-arpon.py new_project projectName
And this will create the basic project layout.

You can also use the new manage.py command::
    ./manage.py arpon_app appName
To create a new app using the sugested layout.
